# Hello You! 
#Prompt the user for his name using the input function. 
name = input('What is your name? ')
# The space in between the value and the close quotation mark, 
#equates to the user not having to use the space bar when prompted for their name. 
print("Hello, %s!" % name)


#Also acceptable
#print("Hello, "+name)
#print(f"Hello, {name}")
#print("Hello, %s" % name)
